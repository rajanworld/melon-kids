### Local Development

This project uses Tailwind CSS via CDN for simplicity. To run the website locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open any HTML file in your web browser

Since we're using Tailwind CSS via CDN, no build step is required for basic viewing and development.

1. Optimize the Tailwind CSS by removing unused styles
2. Minify HTML and CSS files
3. Optimize images for web delivery
4. Set up appropriate caching headers
